# bitwarden-importers

Internal crate implementing format-specific vault importers for the Bitwarden SDK. Do not use
directly.

Exposes `client.importers()` ([`ImporterClient`]) with:

- `import_kdbx` — parses a KeePass KDBX (`.kdbx`) database (3.1 + 4, via the `keepass` crate),
  encrypts the entries for the user's personal vault or a given organization, and submits them to
  the server's import endpoint. Returns per-type counts.
- `import_onepassword` — signs in to a 1Password account with its email, master password and Secret
  Key, asking a caller-supplied prompt for a TOTP code when the account requires one, downloads and
  decrypts every vault the account can open, and submits them the same way. Each vault becomes a
  folder.

## Keeper direct importer

The Keeper "direct" importer logs into Keeper's API and decrypts the vault on-device. Its access
layer is being ported from TypeScript (`clients` repo) into the `keeper` module incrementally
(strangler-fig). The first piece, `keeper::crypto`, implements **Keeper's** formats —
unauthenticated AES-CBC ("aes-v1"), AES-GCM with a prepended nonce ("aes-v2"), an ECDH-P256 →
SHA-256 → AES-GCM scheme, and Keeper's custom `encryptionParams` blob. These are **not** Bitwarden
cryptography and deliberately do not live in `bitwarden-crypto`; Use the RustCrypto crates. The
crypto is currently internal Rust with no WASM / UniFFI bindings — the low-level primitives are
deliberately not exposed across the FFI boundary. Platform bindings will be created once the
structured access layer (records, folders, the `sync-down` protobuf) is ported, so the exposed
surface can be record/folder-level operations rather than raw byte arrays.

## Architecture

The shared "interchange" model (`ImportingCipher`, `CipherType`, `Login`/`Card`/…, and the
`From<ImportingCipher> for CipherView` bridge plus `encrypt_import`) lives in `bitwarden-exporters`
and is reused here — this crate depends on `bitwarden-exporters`. CXF import remains in
`bitwarden-exporters` because it is one half of a bidirectional codec.
