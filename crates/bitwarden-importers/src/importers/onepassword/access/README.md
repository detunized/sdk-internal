# 1Password access module

Read access to a 1Password account. Logging in needs the username, master password and Secret Key,
plus a TOTP passcode when the account has 2FA. Once authenticated it downloads and decrypts every
accessible vault into a native 1Password model.

A Rust port of the OnePassword module in Bitwarden's C# `password-manager-access` library.

The 1P and BW name things differently. 1P has vaults that are independent, could be shared
separately, could have different access rights, encrypted with different keys. They will be imported
into Bitwarden collections. 1P doesn't have folders, only tags.

## Notes

- Supports TOTP 2FA only ATM
- No SSO support
- No service account support (they are not so good for export/import)
- One entry point, `Client::download_all_vaults`. No vault selection, no random access
- Added `aes-gcm`, `hkdf`, `crypto-bigint` and `icu_normalizer` to the workspace, will increase the
  wasm size.
- SRP uses `crypto-bigint` rather than `num-bigint` for the constant-time `modpow`
- The legacy path is transcribed from the client and cannot be tested end to end. Patching the web
  client to mint a `PBES2-HS256` account fails: the server answers `POST /api/v1/user/auth` with a
  400, so no new account can be created on it. `fixtures/master-key-vectors.json` covers the
  derivation for both algorithms instead
- Only the credentials and the keys are zeroed. The decrypted vault data is not

## TODO

- The client fingerprint lives in `identity.rs`: app version, HTTP library and per-platform strings.
  Question: do we need per-platform impersonation, or is one fixed identity enough?
- There are many tests converted from the C# repo, they became very noisy in Rust. Do we even need
  them? See start_registers_an_unknown_device_then_retries for an example.
- Do we need to import password history?
- Legacy SRP (`SRP-4096`) is rejected, the client derives it differently and ends in SHA-1
- This module reaches for `hkdf`, `aes-gcm` and `rsa` directly because `bitwarden-crypto` keeps
  those primitives private. Question: should `bitwarden-crypto` expose them, so feature crates do
  not each depend on RustCrypto themselves?
- A wrong password reports as
  `Internal("unexpected response from 'v2/auth/confirm-key' (HTTP 401)")` rather than
  `BadCredentials`. The server only rejects at `confirm-key`, and its body there is not the
  `errorCode` shape `parse_server_error` understands
- A vault we hold no key for is skipped silently. An item that cannot be read is recorded on
  `Vault::skipped`, but nothing surfaces that count to the caller yet
- `access` is `pub` only so the `test-utils` re-export can reach it, a `pub use` cannot re-export a
  `pub(crate)` module
- The username goes on the wire raw, `v2/auth/methods` and `v3/auth/start` do not get the normalized
  one
- `OnePasswordError::TwoFactorRequired` is never constructed
